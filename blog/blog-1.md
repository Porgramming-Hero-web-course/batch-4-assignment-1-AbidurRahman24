# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript?

Union and Intersection types are important features in TypeScript to help type safety in our code. 
# Union Type
A union type in TypeScript allows a variable to have one of several types. It is represented using the | operator.
* Example: type FrontendDeveloper = 'fakibazDeveloper' | 'juniorDeveloper'
* In this example, a variable of type FrontendDeveloper can have the value "fakibazDeveloper", or "juniorDeveloper",

# Intersection Type
An intersection type combines multiple types into a single type, representing the combination of all types. It is represented using the & operator.
* Example: type FullstackDeveloper = FrontendDeveloper & BackendDeveloper;
* In this example, a variable of type FullstackDeveloper must have both a name property of type.
